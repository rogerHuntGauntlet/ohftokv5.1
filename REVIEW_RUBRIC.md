# Final Review Rubric

This rubric outlines the evaluation criteria for assessing project performance across key dimensions.

## Evaluation Scale
- **Excellent (4-5 points)**
- **Satisfactory (2-3 points)**
- **Needs Improvement (0-1 points)**

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. AI-First Coding Framework

| Score Level | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Excellent (4-5) | - Clearly defined, consistent framework applied across all projects<br>- Can explain how it guides decision-making<br>- Provides specific examples of overcoming challenges<br>- Framework demonstrates adaptability and evolution |
| Satisfactory (2-3) | - Basic approach to AI development with some consistency<br>- Can describe general principles<br>- Lacks detailed examples or adaptation strategies |
| Needs Improvement (0-1) | - No clear framework or completely inconsistent approaches<br>- Unable to explain methodology<br>- Cannot articulate how decisions are made |

### 2. Product Sense

| Score Level | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Excellent (4-5) | - Identifies specific user personas with evidence<br>- Articulates precise problems and solutions<br>- Justifies prioritization with clear reasoning or data<br>- Can explain why specific AI features matter to users |
| Satisfactory (2-3) | - General description of target users and problems<br>- Basic rationale for features provided<br>- May lack specificity or strategic thinking in prioritization |
| Needs Improvement (0-1) | - Cannot identify target users<br>- Unable to explain why features were built<br>- Cannot justify development choices<br>- Feature selection appears random rather than strategic |

### 3. Technical Acumen

| Score Level | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Excellent (4-5) | - Demonstrates comprehensive understanding of AI tools<br>- Explains implementation details with precision<br>- Can discuss tradeoffs between approaches<br>- Code explanations show depth of knowledge |
| Satisfactory (2-3) | - Functional understanding of implementation<br>- Can describe how features work<br>- Some gaps in technical explanation<br>- Core concepts are communicated adequately |
| Needs Improvement (0-1) | - Unable to explain how implementations work<br>- Shows fundamental misunderstanding of technology<br>- Cannot walk through their code effectively |

### 4. Project Quality

| Score Level | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Excellent (4-5) | - All projects function as intended<br>- Polished MVP with thoughtful AI integration<br>- Clear value addition through AI features<br>- Evidence of testing and iteration visible |
| Satisfactory (2-3) | - Most projects function correctly<br>- Working AI features present<br>- UI may need refinement<br>- Some inconsistency in quality but generally acceptable |
| Needs Improvement (0-1) | - Multiple non-functional projects<br>- AI features implemented without clear purpose<br>- Poor execution prevents proper evaluation |

### 5. Communication

| Score Level | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| Excellent (4-5) | - Explains complex concepts with clarity and precision<br>- Responds directly to questions<br>- Demonstrates confidence<br>- Adapts technical language appropriately |
| Satisfactory (2-3) | - Communicates basic concepts adequately<br>- May occasionally be imprecise<br>- Technical language may need adjustment<br>- Generally clear but room for improvement |
| Needs Improvement (0-1) | - Rambles or provides irrelevant information<br>- Cannot explain concepts clearly<br>- Communication issues impede evaluation |
